<h1>About the project and Angular in general:</h1>
<h3>

>Simple project seeking to understand the operation of the tool in an interactive way. A project was developed with a simple animation using the Angular tool.<br><br>
>This tool is very similar to how react native works and uses, but with a few differences such as the use of html and css to style and create pages, besides of course Angular is used for web applications unless you be supported by Ionic+Angular software.
